### 7.5 Implement Regulatory Framework Configuration ✅
**Implementation:**
- Connected sidebar checkboxes to analysis pipeline
- Implemented framework selection validation
  - Warns if no frameworks selected
  - Shows count of selected frameworks
- Passed selected frameworks to `ComplianceChecker`
- Updated UI to reflect selected frameworks:
  - Success indicator when frameworks selected
  - Warning when none selected
  - Disabled analysis button when no frameworks
- Added confidence threshold slider
- Stored framework selection in session state

**Key Features:**
- Real-time framework selection
- Validation feedback
- Session state persistence
- Dynamic UI updates
- Integration with all analysis components

## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Initialization
```python
@st.cache_resource
def get_document_processor():
    return DocumentProcessor()

@st.cache_resource
def get_nlp_analyzer():
    return NLPAnalyzer()

@st.cache_resource
def get_compliance_checker():
    return ComplianceChecker()

@st.cache_resource
def get_recommendation_engine():
    return RecommendationEngine(use_llama=False)
```

### Session State Management
- `processed_document`: Stores processed contract
- `analysis_results`: Stores NLP analysis results
- `compliance_report`: Stores compliance checking results
- `recommendations`: Stores generated recommendations
- `contract_history`: Tracks all analyzed contracts
- `selected_frameworks`: Stores user-selected frameworks

### Error Handling
- Document processing errors (format, corruption, OCR)
- Analysis pipeline errors (model failures, timeouts)
- User input validation errors
- Graceful degradation with fallback messages

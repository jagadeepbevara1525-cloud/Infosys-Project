# Streamlit Application Usage Guide

## Overview
The AI-Powered Regulatory Compliance Checker is now fully integrated with real analysis capabilities. This guide explains how to use the application effectively.

## Getting Started

### 1. Launch the Application

```bash
cd App
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### 2. Configure Regulatory Frameworks

**Location:** Left sidebar under "Regulatory Frameworks"

**Steps:**
1. Select one or more frameworks to check against:
   - ‚úÖ GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
   - ‚úÖ HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
   - ‚úÖ CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
   - ‚úÖ SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)

2. At least one framework must be selected
3. The UI will show a warning if no frameworks are selected
4. A success message shows the count of selected frameworks

**Note:** Framework selection affects all subsequent analyses

### 3. Adjust Analysis Settings (Optional)

**Location:** Left sidebar under "Analysis Settings"

**Available Settings:**
- **Risk Tolerance:** Low / Medium / High
- **Confidence Threshold:** 50% - 95% (default: 75%)
  - Higher threshold = more conservative classification
  - Lower threshold = more clauses classified with lower confidence

## Understanding Results

### Compliance Scores

- **90-100%:** Excellent compliance
- **80-89%:** Good compliance, minor issues
- **70-79%:** Moderate compliance, needs attention
- **Below 70%:** Poor compliance, immediate action required

### Risk Levels

- **High (Red):** Critical issues, legal/financial risk
  - Missing mandatory clauses
  - Violations of key requirements
  - Immediate remediation needed

- **Medium (Yellow):** Important issues, moderate risk
  - Incomplete clauses
  - Missing recommended elements
  - Should be addressed soon

- **Low (Green):** Minor issues, low risk
  - Compliant clauses
  - Minor improvements possible
  - No immediate action required

## Best Practices

### 1. Document Preparation
- Use high-quality scans for image-based PDFs
- Ensure text is readable and well-formatted
- Remove unnecessary headers/footers if possible

### 2. Framework Selection
- Select only relevant frameworks for your use case
- Don't select all frameworks unless necessary
- Consider your industry and jurisdiction

### 3. Analysis Workflow
1. Upload document
2. Review extraction results
3. Select appropriate frameworks
4. Run analysis
5. Review dashboard for overview
6. Examine clause details for specifics
7. Address high-risk items first
8. Review recommendations
9. Export results for documentation

### 4. Interpreting Results
- Focus on high-risk items first
- Review missing requirements carefully
- Consider confidence scores when evaluating classifications
- Use recommendations as guidance, not absolute rules
- Consult legal professionals for final decisions

### 5. Performance Tips
- Smaller documents process faster
- Text-based PDFs are faster than scanned PDFs
- Fewer frameworks = faster analysis
- Use caching (automatic) for repeated analyses

## Troubleshooting

### Document Upload Issues

**Problem:** File upload fails
- **Solution:** Check file size (max 10MB), format (PDF/DOCX/TXT/PNG/JPG)

**Problem:** OCR extraction fails
- **Solution:** Ensure Tesseract is installed, try text-based PDF instead

**Problem:** No clauses extracted
- **Solution:** Check document formatting, ensure text is readable

### Analysis Issues

**Problem:** Analysis button disabled
- **Solution:** Upload a document first, select at least one framework

**Problem:** Low confidence scores
- **Solution:** Normal for ambiguous clauses, review manually

**Problem:** Analysis takes too long
- **Solution:** Large documents take time, be patient, check logs

### Display Issues

**Problem:** Dashboard shows no data
- **Solution:** Run an analysis first

**Problem:** Filters show no results
- **Solution:** Adjust filter settings, check if clauses match criteria

## Technical Details

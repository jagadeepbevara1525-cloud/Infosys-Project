See [GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md](config/GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Usage:**
1. Select "Google Sheets URL" as the upload method
2. Paste your Google Sheets URL
3. (Optional) Specify sheet name and cell range in Advanced Options

üìÑ Extracted 12 clauses (1,890 words)
```

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 10MB
- **Minimum text length**: 100 characters
- Files exceeding the limit will be rejected with a clear error message

## Error Handling

### File Upload Errors

**Unsupported Format:**
```
‚ùå Unsupported file format: .xyz
Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, PNG, JPG
```

**File Too Large:**
```
‚ùå File size (15.2 MB) exceeds maximum allowed size (10 MB)
```

**Corrupted File:**
```
‚ùå Error processing document: File appears corrupted
```

### Text Input Errors

**Text Too Short:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Please enter at least 100 characters of contract text
```

**Empty Input:**
```
‚ùå Error processing text: Text input cannot be empty
```

### Google Sheets Errors

**Invalid URL:**
```
‚ùå Invalid Google Sheets URL
Expected format: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{id}/edit
```

**Authentication Error:**
```
‚ùå Google API credentials not found
See troubleshooting tips below
```

**Permission Denied:**
```
‚ùå The caller does not have permission
Ensure the sheet is shared with the service account
```

**No Data Found:**
```
‚ùå No data found in the specified range
Verify the cell range contains data
```

## Troubleshooting

### Google Sheets Issues

1. **Authentication Error**
   - Ensure `google_credentials.json` is in `App/config/`
   - Verify the credentials file is valid JSON
   - Check that Google Sheets API is enabled

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Share the Google Sheet with the service account email
   - Grant at least "Viewer" access
   - Wait a few minutes for permissions to propagate

3. **Sheet Not Found**
   - Verify the URL is correct
   - Check that the sheet exists
   - Ensure the sheet name (if specified) is correct

4. **No Data Found**
   - Verify the cell range is correct
   - Ensure cells contain text data
   - Try leaving range empty to read all data

### OCR Issues

1. **Poor OCR Quality**
   - Ensure image is high resolution (300+ DPI)
   - Check that text is clearly visible
   - Avoid skewed or rotated images

2. **Tesseract Not Installed**
   - Install Tesseract OCR: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
   - Add Tesseract to system PATH
   - Restart the application

### General Processing Issues

1. **Processing Takes Too Long**
   - Large files may take longer to process
   - OCR processing is slower than text extraction
   - Consider splitting large documents

2. **Incorrect Clause Segmentation**
   - Ensure document has clear structure
   - Use headings and numbering
   - Check for proper paragraph breaks

## Best Practices

### For File Uploads
- Use text-based PDFs when possible (faster processing)
- Ensure scanned documents are high quality
- Keep files under 10MB for optimal performance

### For Text Input
- Include complete clauses with context
- Maintain original formatting and structure
- Use for quick analysis or testing

### For Google Sheets
- Organize contract text in a single column
- Use clear cell ranges for specific sections
- Keep one contract per sheet for clarity
- Share sheets with service account before processing

## Performance Considerations

| Input Method | Typical Processing Time | Best For |
|--------------|------------------------|----------|
| Text-based PDF | 1-3 seconds | Standard contracts |
| Scanned PDF/Image | 5-15 seconds | Legacy documents |
| DOCX | 1-2 seconds | Modern contracts |
| Text Input | < 1 second | Quick analysis |
| Google Sheets | 2-5 seconds | Collaborative workflows |

## Security Notes

### File Upload
- Files are processed in temporary storage
- Temporary files are deleted after processing
- No files are permanently stored on server

### Text Input
- Text is processed in memory only
- No persistent storage of input text
- Session data cleared on browser close

### Google Sheets
- Uses service account authentication
- Read-only access to sheets
- Credentials stored securely in config folder
- Never commit credentials to version control
